#HTML Tags, Image Attachments, and Link Adding
This repository contains a small project focusing on HTML tags, image attachments, and link adding. It aims to demonstrate how these fundamental elements of HTML can be used to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the project.
imag/: A directory containing image files used in the project.

HTML Tags
The project showcases various HTML tags to structure and formats the content. These tags include, but are not limited to:
<h1> to <h6>: Heading tags for different levels of headings.
<p>: Paragraph tag for text content.
<ul> and <li>: Unordered list and list item tags.
<ol> and <li>: Ordered list and list item tags.
<div>: A container tag used for grouping and styling elements.
<span>: An inline tag used for styling specific parts of the text.

Image Attachment
The project demonstrates how to attach images to HTML pages. The images/ directory contains image files used in the project. These images can be displayed using the <img> tag with the appropriate src attribute. It showcases how to specify image dimensions and alternative text, and utilize other attributes to enhance image accessibility and styling.

Link Adding
The project also covers the addition of links to HTML pages. It shows how to create internal and external links using the <a> tag. Internal links are used to navigate within the same web page or between different project pages. External links, on the other hand, can be used to link to external websites or resources.
